0.14
----

* Fix: fix a reported string incompatibility with Python 3.9.
* Fix: make all internal tests pass.
* Change: report the new repository home.

0.13
----

* New: make the text editor configurable. It can be specified in the
  configuration file or the editor can be passed with `topydo edit -E nano`.
  This makes it also much easier to introduce 'filters', to process (a selection
  of) todo items through an external command.
* New: with `revert ls` you can list all backups, with `revert NUM` you can
  restore backup NUM (thanks to @mruwek).
* New: tab-completion in column mode (thanks to @mruwek).
* New: the commandline in column mode understands basic readline shortcuts:
  - Ctrl-a: move cursor to the beginning
  - Ctrl-e: move cursor to the end
  - Ctrl-u: delete from the cursor back to the beginning
  - Ctrl-k: delete from the cursor to the end

  (thanks to @mruwek).
* New: 'Mark all' in column mode: simply use Ctrl-A (thanks to @mruwek).
* New list format specifiers (for `ls -F`):
  - %n: line number
  - %N: padded line number
  - %u: text-based ID
  - %U: padded text-based ID

  The identifiers %i and %I print whatever is configured (default: line
  numbers).
* New: `dep ls` was extended to understand the words `before` and `after`. For
  example `topydo dep ls before 1` is equivalent to `topydo dep ls 1 to`
  (thanks to @mruwek).
* New: introduce 'identifier_alphabet' option in the configuration, allowing
  you to choose which characters should be used for the text-based identifiers.
  This is a convenience for Dvorak typists (like me), to only use characters on
  the base row (and other conveniently positioned characters).

* Fix: crash when running `help` in column mode.
* Fix: better handling of incorrect dates. The `postpone` command would crash
  when a todo item has an invalid due date (e.g. 2016-06-31).
* Fix: take hide tags into account in column mode.
* Fix: print the correct todo IDs in the `do` or `del` output (thanks to
  @mruwek).
* Fix: make `add -f` more robust when the file does not exist (thanks to
  @mruwek).
* Fix: `ls -n` would not print anything under some circumstances, e.g. when
  todos are hidden.
* Fix: Do not apply ordinal filtering (<, >, =) when a tag appears more than
  once.
* Fix: crash when launching column mode in Windows. This mode is not supported,
  you may use Cygwin instead.
* Fix: crash when an option appears twice in the configuration file. The
  last value for an option will be used (thanks to @mruwek).
* Fix: fix padding for todo IDs.
* Fix: instruct users to use 'pip3' instead of 'pip' (thanks to @mruwek).

* Change: `tag`, `append` and `dep` can work with multiple todo IDs. This
  allows you to apply these commands on all marked items. Use {} as a
  placeholder for the multiple IDs, e.g. `tag {} due today` (thanks to
  @mruwek).
* Change: completed items have a grey progress color.
* Change: show group names with relative (humanized) dates when they represent
  dates.
* Change: print empty output when `dep ls` has no output. Improves feedback to
  user in column mode (thanks to @mruwek).
* Change: show an error message when parsing the list format fails (thanks to
  @mruwek).
* Change: use filter expression when no title was given for a column in the
  column definition file (thanks to @mruwek).
* Change: Ctrl-C does not abort column mode anymore, use :quit or :exit
  instead.

0.12
----

* New: The `tag` subcommand understands relative dates with the `-r` flag:
  `tag -r foo value` will interpret value as a relative date and convert to an
  absolute date.

* Fix: escape special characters in Dot output.
* Fix: when deleting the last column in column mode, no new columns could be
  added. This is fixed by showing the column definition view to add a new
  column.

* Change: output in column UI remains visible when : is pressed (instead of
  Enter or Escape to discard).

0.11
----

* New: `ls` can group items with the `-g` flag, accepting a group expression
  (which has the same format as a sort expression). To group items by project,
  run: `topydo ls -g project`.
* New: `ls` can print todo items in the Graphviz Dot format, such that
  dependencies can be visualized. Use `ls -f dot`, or
  `topydo ls -f dot +ProjectA | dot -Tsvg -o projectA.svg` to make a graph for
  project A.
* New: Focus and mark colors are customizable in the column UI (thanks to
  @colinsullivan).
* New: todo items can be hidden by adding a `h:1` tag (thanks to @MinchinWeb).
* New: an alternative column definition file can be given with the `-l` flag:
  `topydo columns -l /path/to/columns.conf` (thanks to @mruwek).

* Fix: column UI reloads automatically when the todo.txt file was changed
  externally.
* Fix: `edit` did not work on some operating systems (e.g. Mac OS X).
* Fix: relative dates were sometimes one day off.
* Fix: Minor importance calculation fix during the weekend for distant mondays
  (thanks to @aetherknight).
* Fix: completed items are displayed correctly in the column UI.
* Fix: tests were made more deterministic.

* Change: Performance improvements for the column UI, it scales better with
  large todo lists.
* Change: temporary files (for editing) will be detected as todo.txt files by
  the todo.txt-vim plugin.

0.10.1
------

* Fix: items without priority are shown in the console of the Column UI.

0.10
----

A major release, introducing a new user interface (TUI). Special thanks go to
@mruwek for helping out to get this UI in its current shape.

* New: A column-based user interface. Each column has its own filters and sort
  order, allowing you to build a dashboard with your todo items. Launch with
  `topydo columns`.
* New: color blocks that change from green to red (overdue) as time passes by.
  Use the %z placeholder to add color blocks to the `ls` output.
* New: color option can be set to 0, 1, 16 or 256 and if needed overridden by
  -C on the commandline.
* New: recurrence based on business days. Skips Saturdays and Sundays when
  calculating the next date (thanks to @mruwek).
* New: items can be sorted by length (use 'length' as sort field).
* New: parents-of and children-of operators with `add`, `dep` and `append`
  subcommands. The todo item receives the same parents/children from the
  specified todo item.
* New: `append` understands relative dates and other tags that are special to
  `add` (thanks to @rameshg87).

* Fix: dependency ID creation with orphan todo items.
* Fix: crash after completing/deleting an edited item.
* Fix: crash after completing an item that got a new dependency with `dep add`
* Fix: crash when archive filename is empty (fixed by @mruwek).

* Change: a new tag value with an existing key can be added with the tag
  subcommand (thanks to @MinchinWeb)
* Change: ~/.config/topydo/config can be used as a configuration file.
* Change: No backups are written for read-only commands (e.g. lsprj)
* Change: topydo is more scalable for large todo.txt files.

* Known issue: color blocks are not shown in `ls` output in the column UI.

* Misc: topydo also has its own website at topydo.org. All commands and
  features are documented there.

0.9
---

* Dropped support for Python 2.7.
* Add ability to filter on creation/completion dates:

        topydo ls created:today
        topydo ls completed:today
        topydo -t done.txt completed:today # if auto-archiving is set

* `ls -F` supports `%P` that expands to a single space when no priority is set,
  in contrast to `%p` which expands to an empty string (thanks to @MinchinWeb).
* `ls -N` prints enough todo items such that it fits on one screen (thanks to
  @MinchinWeb).
* Aliases can have a `{}` placeholder which is substituted with the alias'
  arguments (thanks to @mruwek).
* `pri` accepts priorities in lowercase (thanks to @MinchinWeb).
* Several bugfixes for `dep gc`.
* Various test/CI improvements.

0.8
---

* `do -d` understands relative dates.

* Introduced `yesterday` as a relative date (abbrev. `yes`).

* `tag` command understands relative dates when setting due or t tags.

* Fix install of wheels (unnecessarily installed dependencies). Issue #79.

* Bugfix: the negation of ordinal tag filters did not work.

* Some improvements in test coverage (a.o. thanks to @mruwek).

0.7
---

A big release with many new features. Many thanks to Jacek Sowi≈Ñski (@mruwek)
for the majority of these new features.

* `ls` output can be customized with a -F flag or a configuration option:

        [ls]
        list_format = |%I| %x %{(}p{)} %c %s %k %{due:}d %{t:}t

  or `ls -F "%{(}p{)} %s %{due:}d"`.

  See `help ls` for all placeholders. Each placeholder can optionally be
  surrounded by optional texts that are only printed when the placeholder is
  expanded to a value.

  The format string may contain a tab character: all text that follows is
  aligned to the right.

  (thanks to @mruwek)
* New subcommand: `revert`. Revert the last executed command(s). The number of
  revisions can be tuned in the configuration file:

      [topydo]
      backup_count = 25

  Set to 0 to disable this feature. (thanks to @mruwek)
* New feature: aliases. Aliases can be defined in the configuration file:

        [aliases]
        showall = ls -x

  (thanks to @mruwek)
* Filter based on priorities (thanks to @mruwek)

      ls (A)
      ls (<A)

* `ls` has a `-n` flag to limit the number of todo items (similar to the
  list_limit option in the configuration file:

      ls -n 5

* `ls` has a `-i` flag to select displaying todo items based on their ID. This
  can be useful to have a 'clean' default view, and to gather more details for
  a certain todo item using aliases and formatting.
* Prompt mode no longer warns about background modifications to todo.txt when a
  read-only command is entered (e.g. `ls`).
* Removed restriction in `edit` mode that requires keeping the same amount of
  lines in the todo.txt file.
* `edit` only processes the todo items when edits were actually made in the
  editor (thanks to @mruwek)
* When entering today's day of the week as a relative date, it will use next
  week's date instead of today.
* Bugfix: not all tags were properly hidden with the `hide_tags` configuration
  option.
* Better PEP8 compliance (thanks to @MinchinWeb)
* Various test/CI improvements (thanks to @MinchinWeb)
* Support for Python 3.2 removed.
* Many other minor improvements (a.o. thanks to @MinchinWeb)

0.6
---

* Recurrence patterns can be prefixed with a `+` to indicate strict recurrence
  (i.e. based on due date rather than completion date. This syntax is inspired
  from the SimpleTask project by @mpcjanssen.
* Colors now work on the Windows commandline (thanks to @MinchinWeb). Requires
  colorama to be installed.
* Do not print spurious color codes when colors are disabled in the
  configuration (thanks to @MinchinWeb).
* In prompt mode, restore old auto-completion behavior: press Tab for
  completion (instead of complete while typing).
* Various other minor fixes (thanks to @MinchinWeb).

0.5
---

* Remove 'ical' subcommand in favor of 'topydo ls -f ical'
* Remove options highlight_projects_colors in favor of colorscheme options. In
  case you wish to disable the project/context colors, assign an empty value in
  the configuration file:

      [colorscheme]
      project_color =
      context_color =
* `del`, `depri`, `do`, `pri`, `postpone` now support now expression like `ls`
  does, using the `-e` flag (Jacek Sowi≈Ñski, @mruwek).
* Fix `ls` when searching for a certain key:value where value is a string.
* Disable auto archive when the option archive_filename is empty.
* Add option auto_creation_date to enable/disable the creation date being added
  to new todo items.
* Calculate relative dates correctly in long-running `prompt` sessions.
* `pri` also accepts priorities in the form (A), [A] or any other bracket.
* Add `listcontext` and `listcontexts` as aliases of `lscon`.
* Highlight tags when the value is one character long.
* Cleanups

0.4.1
-----

* Fix infinite loop when `keep_sorted` is enabled in the configuration.
* Depend on prompt-toolkit >= 0.39, which fixes the history functionality in
  prompt mode (up/down keys).

0.4
---

* A new prompt mode with autocompletion. To enable, run `pip install
  prompt-toolkit`, then `topydo prompt`.
* Support for Python 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 (note that iCalendar output does not
  work in Python 3.2)
* Better Unicode support.
* `add` command has the `-f` flag to add todo items from a file (or use `-` to
  read from standard input) (Jacek Sowi≈Ñski - @mruwek)
* Customizable colors + additional highlighting of tags and URLs (Jacek
  Sowi≈Ñski (@mruwek) and @kidpixo).
* Make sure that the `edit` subcommand always uses the correct todo.txt file.
* `ls` subcommand has the `-f` flag to specify the output format. Currently,
  three formats are supported:
  * `text` - The default plain text format.
  * `ical` - iCalendar (WARNING: this deprecates the `ical` subcommand)
  * `json` - Javascript Object Notation (JSON)
* Resolve `~` to home directory if used in a configuration file
  (@robertvanbregt).
* Various minor fixes.

Again, I'd like to thank Jacek (@mruwek) for his assistance and contributions
in this release.

0.3
---

* `edit` subcommand accepts a list of numbers or an expression to select which
  items to edit. (Jacek Sowi≈Ñski)
* The commands `del`, `do`, `pri`, `depri` and `postpone` can operate on multiple
  todo items at once. (Jacek Sowi≈Ñski)
* A new `ical` subcommand that outputs in the iCalendar format.
* New configuration option: `append_parent_contexts`. Similar to
  `append_parent_projects` where the parent's contexts are automatically added
  to child todo items. (Jacek Sowi≈Ñski)
* New configuration option: `hide_tags` to hide certain tags from the `ls`
  output. Multiple tags can be specified separated by commas. By default, `p`,
  `id` and `ical` are hidden.
* Properly complete todo items with invalid recurrence patterns (`rec` tag).
* Fix assignment of dependency IDs: in some cases two distinct todos get the
  same dependency ID.

Big thanks to Jacek (@mruwek) for his contributions in this release.

0.2
---

* A new `edit` subcommand to launch an editor with the configured todo.txt file.
* Introduced textual identifiers in addition to line numbers.

  Line numbers are still the default, textual identifiers can be enabled with
  the option `identifiers = text` in the configuration file (see topydo.conf).
  The advantage of these identifiers is that they are less prone to changes when
  something changes in the todo.txt file. For example, identifiers are much more
  likely to remain the same when completing a todo item (and archiving it). With
  linenumbers, all todo items below the completed one would get a new
  identifier.
* Relative dates with months and years are more accurate now (thanks to Jacek
  Sowi≈Ñski).
* Multiple items can be marked as complete or deleted at once.
* Added option to automatically add the projects of the parent todo item when
  adding a child todo item. Enable `append_parent_projects` in topydo.conf.
* `topydo help` shows a list of available subcommands. Moreover, you can run
  `topydo help <subcommand>` as well.
* Let setuptools provide a `topydo` executable.
* Various other fixes.

0.1.2
-----

* Handle recurrence properly when a custom completion date is given.
* Allow any tag to have a date value (so it can be filtered as such).

0.1.1
-----

* Write newline character at the end of todo.txt and done.txt files.
* Tag values must be at least one character long.
* Made filtering a bit more robust w.r.t. integer expressions.

0.1
